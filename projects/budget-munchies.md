## About
Budget Munchies is a web application designed for UH Manoa students. The goal is for students to have access to cheap and easy homemade recipes, so they can improve their eating habits and hopefully save some money in the process of doing so. The application features recipes categorized by meal type, vendors that sell groceries or ready-made food, and a social media-like aspect where students may share recipes with their fellow peers.

## My Roles
I did not have much experience, so I mostly focused on the backend of the project. I worked on creating the collections, getting the favorites to work, the navbar, and the users page. Getting the favorites button to work took me the most amount of time. I wanted to make sure that when it was clicked it would add the recipe to the user's favorites collection if it wasn't already in there. However, if it was, then it would remove the recipe from the favorites collection and reduce the number of likes associated with the recipe. I utilized underscore and javascript's built-in functions to save time and help me out.

## A Learning Experience
Not only did I learn a lot about software engineering through this project, but I learned a lot about collaborating with other people. It was especially interesting for this project because it was during a time when we had to social distance, so we could not meet up face-to-face. Working in a group taught me a lot about who I am as a person and what I need to work on to become a better teammate. I learned that procrastination is not an option when you have your teammates' grades at stake and not just your own. Agile project management really helped me with spacing out my deadlines and planning when I would accomplish each task.
