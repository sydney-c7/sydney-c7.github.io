## What's all the fuss about software engineering?
To be quite honest, I know little to nothing about software engineering, but this does not mean that I am uninterested.  When I hear the words "software engineering", I think of all the amazing technology that's available to us today because of the software engineers that bring their ideas to life.  I am most interested in the creative and innovative aspects of software engineering.  I love drawing out my ideas and poking holes in my plans.  I love working through all of the problems in not only the code, but the idea as well because seeing my ideas come to life even better than how I imagined them is the most satisfying feeling.

Specifically in software engineering, I am interested in application development because it is amazing how lines of code on a computer can come together to create endless possibilities that can entertain and help people.  Applications on a phone or computer are what make them more user-friendly and useful.  I am also interested in artificial intelligence because it is fascinating how we can make algorithms that are similar to the human mind.  This means that there are many patterns that the human mind follows.  The crossover between psychology and computer science fascinates me, so I would love to work on engineering the software for an AI robot.

## My Goals
I hope that I am able to develop the skills necesssary to bring my ideas to life.  I also want to develop a more creative mindset because I often find it hard to think of applications or websites that I want to create.  To develop a creative mind I hope that I find more activities and topics that peak my interest.  I also want to experience an internship for software engineering because I am not sure what I want to do with my computer science degree after I graduate.  The possibilities are endless, but I need more experience in the different fields of software engineering to get a better feel of which one is my passion.  Specifically from my ICS 314 class, I hope that I push myself to pursue a variety of projects like creating websites, applications, and more efficient algorithms that challenge my brain to think outside of the box.

The one thing I truly aim for in software engineering is finding a happy medium between being outside and coding.  I hope that when I study more software engineering I am able to figure out a project where I am able to successfully incorporate the part of me that hates to sit down and loves to go outside into a coding project.  From my limited knowledge, I have seen that most software engineers sit at a desk and attend meetings all day.  I hope I am able to experience the software engineering life in an outside setting.  Software engineering is such a broad field which opens up the possibilities to what I am able to explore and achieve!
