## Clockwork
After completing my first ever software engineering class I can safely say that I need to know more. I feel a little empty leaving with knowledge that is only the tip of the iceberg in software engineering, but the beginner knwoledge I have gained from my first software engineering class was definitely eye-opening not only in the field of computer science, but also in my everyday life. Learning about agile project management and functional programming were especially useful and easy for me to implement into my daily life.

## 
Agile project management is breaking down a project into sections or phases called "milestones" that set soft deadlines. Milestones were great for a procrastinator like me. It prevented me from waiting till the day before everything is due to finish everything. Thanks to milestones I was able to space out my work and have a mostly stress-free, enjoyable project. These milestones were then broken down further into smaller goals that were achievable in a shorter time span called "issues". Issues were problems or goals that were achievable within a few days. Issues helped me breakdown the project into smaller parts to see what needed to actually get done to come together at the end and create a cohesive end product.

This type of project management proved to be great for my group software engineering project because it kept everyone from slacking and falling behind. It's easy to see the usefulness of this approach in school and work when we are required to collaborate with others on an assignment or project, but it also proves to be useful in my household as well. I currently live with three other people who are all college students with a part time job, so each of us is busy and usually neglects the cleaniness of the common areas. After learning about agile project management, I brought up an idea to my roommates that would keep the common area clean, but make sure that everyone is helping out and it's not just one person. I proposed that we have a board that allocates chores, like issues, to a person and everyone has to complete these set of chores by a certain deadline, like a milestone. It prevents the housework from piling and makes cleaning the entire common area more achievable because we're breaking them down into smaller tasks.
