## First Encounter
When I first encountered computer science, I thought that Java was the abbreviation of Javascript.  Now I understand that they are two completely different languages.  Although I wouldn't get too ahead of myself and say that I know everything there is to know about the differences between these languages.  The truth is that I know only of a few of the many differences between the two languages.  I am still new to the language, so I often find myself relating it back to my first programming language, Java.  The syntax of the languages are very similar, so it's easy for me to pick up.

## Differences
I do see a major difference in the flexibility because Java is more rigid and Javascript is more relaxed.  I was surprised when Javascript didn't require a specification for variable type in the parameters of the a function.  I enjoyed the flexibility because I didn't have to worry about variable types and I could return the necessary variable type as needed whether it be an integer or a string.  Because of this flexibility I think Javascript is a good programming language.  Software engineers can worry about the bigger issues like time and space complexitiy and not the smaller insignificant bugs like the variable types getting all mixed up.

## WODs
While doing the practice WODs I found myself applying the same thinking I use when I type in Java even though I as using Javascript.  After completeing the WOD for today's class I realized that the thinking is the same.  It's all about patterns.  When Professor Johnson showed his code using a simple extra function that he can call on both arrays instead of typing double the code for each array, I realized that although my solution worked I did it in an inefficient way.  I hope that throughout this class as I do more WODs and learn more Javascript I can make my code more efficient.

These WODs are extremely useful in working my mind to move fast, but also think of different ways I can solve a problem and picking the best solution.  It's a fun and exciting way to practice problem solving on a smaller scale.  We work in partners, so it's fun to talk about the problem and hear my partner's take on the problem.  It is also difficult at the same time because I have a hard time putting my ideas into words.  I also have a hard time explaining my code.  The WODs are perfect for improving this because I can practice explaining my code and putting it into terms that other people can understand.  When I go to meetings at my future job, I'll be able to confidently explain my code and ideas to the larger population.

### An Exciting Future
I look forward to the future of ICS314 where I can experience more WODs and learn more Javascript and other languages!
