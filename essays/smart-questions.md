## Why We Should Ask Smart Questions
Throughout the history of mankind, people grew from curiosity.  Curiosity is what sparked the flame for change and innovation.  When it comes to asking questions to fulfill one's curiosity, asking questions in a "smart way" yields not only a better response, but helps the person in question with his/her understanding of his/her own question.  Asking a smart question that is precise and thought-provoking attracts software engineers that are willing to help and reflect the same amount of effort put in the question.  By asking a smart question, we avoid wasting both the person in question and the person answering's time.

## An Example of a "Not Smart" Question
Here is a link to the question on Stack Overflow: [The Question in Question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65941432/how-do-i-make-a-user-pay-before-creating-user-account-django).
A user on the popular site for computer science related inquery, Stack Overflow, asked for help with creating a website where the users would have to pay before registration.  The questioner is using Django as the open-source web framework and he/she wants the user of his/her site to pay before creating an account.  He/she claims to be a beginner and just asks how to accomplish his goal without any specificity.  This question is a perfect example of a "not smart" question because it uses informal language, reflects that he/she has not attempted to search on the web, and does not describe the problem he/she is having.  The user starts off the question with informal language saying, "Okay.. so" and then proceeds to state the goal.  Starting off the question with such informal language shows other software engineers that you are not truly serious about your question and it is not important enough for you to put in the effort of asking correctly. In addition to informal language, the question also reflects that the user has not attempted to search the web for help.  The user does not reflect if he/she has searched the web because the user just states his/her goal and that he/she needs help.  The question reflects no attempts to solving the problem because it does not describe any problems that the user ran into while attempting to reach the goal.

### A Lazy Answer for a Lazy Question
The question above reflected the least amount of effort a user could put into a public forum question and thus the user received a lackluster response.
