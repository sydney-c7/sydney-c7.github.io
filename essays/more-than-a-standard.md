## My Experience with ESLint
I recently had my first iteractive experience with coding standards in my software engineering class.  My class required that we use ESLint to check our coding style and quality

## The Applications
After spending some time to get used to the coding standards, I started to realize the true usefulness of having software engineers follow these coding standards.  When we follow a set of guidelines for coding, our code becomes cleaner.  Clean code is easier to debug because the code does not look like a jumbled mess with random spacing and unused variables.  Following the coding standards also helps other software engineers because having clean, well-formatted code helps others understand what each function and line of code does.  It helps with putting the pieces together and understanding the overall purpose of the code.  When other software engineers can understand the code, they can help the coder improve the code and debug it as well.  I understand that it can be a hassle to follow a certain coding style because code is supposed to be a medium for expressing one's creativity and ideas.  Rather than thinking about coding standards as restrictions, it's better to describe them as guideposts.  These standards do not restrict the capabilities of the code, instead they provide a cleaner and more efficient way to use the coding space.
